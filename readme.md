# The TDL application

## Introduction

The TDL (To Do List) application was build as a final project for a Syntra course.
It allows the user to add, remove and edit todos, contacts and appointments.

As such it allows the user to organize his or hers personal life.

## The application

The application was build in React. Redux was used during development for slices and API calls.
React-Toastify package was used for messages to the user. Which allows a fluent communication system with the user.
Nookies was used to add cookies to the application.

In the back end of the project we used PhP / Symfony.
This allowed the use of Doctrine and ORM for database / class management and API Platform for detailed and accurate API calls.

## Project notes
The project was build in slighty about 3,5 weeks.
There are multiple front pages, with a login and register.
This to access the actual application.
The application itself serves the purpose as a demo for a school project.
Not for implementation & actual use.
